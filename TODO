del n(i)
   if n aliased, transparent
   if n(i) aliased, must do real var
del n

Most of the MakeVar, etc, routines should be moved into VariableTree
and VarStack classes. The routines should then mostly be one-line
calles to frames.

Differences with standard Tcl:

- comments can begin anywhere a word is expected; a comment
	acts as a command terminator. Thus:

	set a 2 # comment

  is legitimate (not in real Tcl), and equivalent to:

	set a 2 ;# comment

- no floating point support as yet
- errorcode variable not supported (including in exit/return)
- no support for lists in glob yet.
- Tcl exec replaced by simple exec/execcatch for now (about the
	best we can do under DOS, or is it with DOS>=5.0?

- Extra commands:

	decr
	clear : clear the screen
	execcatch
	sleep

TEST:
	return and exit options/args
	file command

TODO:
	array searches are incomplete
	complete "regexp"
	"regsub"
	"file readlink"
	"pid"
	Fancy features of exec under UNIX
	"open |" ?
	History list with hooks to command editor
	Add floating point expressions & math functions
	  and expand expression set to full set of operators.
	Enhance the scan/format stuff (esp. scan)
