An implementation of Tcl. Mostly faithful.

One day in the mid 1990's I got a copy of John Ousterhout's Tcl
book. I hadn't used the language before, but after reading a few 
chapters I was so impressed by the elegance of the design that I
spent the next two days in a frenzy writing this code just for fun.
